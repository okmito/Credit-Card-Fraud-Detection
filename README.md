## 📖 About The Project
This project provides an interactive web interface to demonstrate a real-world machine learning application.  
It uses a **Logistic Regression** model to classify credit card transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent based on anonymized features.  
The system is designed as a practical example of deploying an ML model with Flask.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Model**: Logistic Regression trained to detect fraudulent transactions.  
- ⚙️ **Data Scaling**: Implements `StandardScaler` to normalize input features.  
- 🌐 **Interactive Web Interface**: Flask app with HTML/CSS/JavaScript front end.  
- 🎲 **Dynamic Data Generation**: *Generate Random Sample* button for quick testing with randomized realistic data.  
- 📈 **Real-time Predictions**: Displays prediction and confidence score instantly.

## 🚀 Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python **3.7+**
- `pip` (Python package installer)
- `git`

### 2. Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
cd credit-card-fraud-detection
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download the dataset:  
The model is trained on the **Credit Card Fraud Detection** dataset from Kaggle.  

👉 [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)  

Place the downloaded `creditcard.csv` file in the **root directory** of the project.

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1. Train the model
Run the training script:
```bash
python model_training.py
```
This creates a `model/` folder containing the trained model and scaler.

### 2. Start the web application
```bash
python app.py
```

### 3. Access the application
Open your browser and navigate to:  
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
